	abstract = {Prior research has demonstrated an association between lead exposure and criminal behavior at the population-level, however studies exploring the effect of lead exposure on criminal behavior at the individual-level have not been reviewed systematically. The intent of this study is to complete a systematic review of all studies assessing individual-level exposures to lead and the outcomes of crime and antisocial behavior traits. We included peer reviewed studies that were published prior to August 2022 and were classified as cohort, cross-sectional, or case-control. Studies measuring the outcomes of crime, delinquency, violence, or aggression were included. The following databases were searched using a standardized search strategy: ProQuest Environmental Science Database, PubMed, ToxNet and the Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS). Seventeen manuscripts met our inclusion criteria. Blood lead was measured in 12 studies, bone lead in 3 studies, and dentine lead levels in 2 studies. This systematic review identified a wide range of diverse outcomes between exposure to lead at multiple windows of development and later delinquent, criminal and antisocial behavior. A review of all potential confounding variables included within each study was made, with inclusion of relevant confounders into the risk of bias tool. There is limited data at the individual level on the effects of prenatal, childhood, and adolescent lead exposure and later criminal behavior and more evidence is necessary to evaluate the magnitude of the associations seen in this review. Our review, in conjunction with the available biological evidence, suggests that an excess risk for criminal behavior in adulthood exists when an individual is exposed to lead in utero or in the early years of childhood. The authors report no conflict of interest and no funding source., Clinical trial registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42021268379.},

	abstract = {Background:
Childhood lead poisoning remains an important public health issue in the United States, as well as elsewhere in the world. Although primary prevention is a major goal and it is critically important to keep children from getting poisoned, it is also important to explore ways to reduce the neurotoxic effects of lead in those children already poisoned. Whether lead-induced neurotoxicity and its related adverse outcomes are viewed as “permanent” or “persistent” may influence the way in which potential remediation efforts are considered for improving outcomes from childhood lead poisoning.

Objectives:
The objective of this commentary was to discuss the ideas of permanence and persistence in relation to the direct neurotoxic effects of lead on the brain and the resulting adverse outcomes from these effects. Recent new insights regarding potential mitigation of lead-induced neurotoxic effects on brain and behavior are considered along with clinical information on neurorehabilitation to suggest potential strategies for improving cognitive/behavioral outcomes in lead-poisoned children.

Discussion:
The distinction between permanent and persistent in regard to lead-induced neurotoxicity and its resulting outcomes may have broad implications for public health policies in response to the problem of childhood lead exposure. The term permanent implies that the damage is irreversible with little chance of improvement. However, there is evidence that at least some of the adverse cognitive/behavioral outcomes from lead exposure are persistent rather than permanent and potentially amenable, under the appropriate circumstances, to some level of mitigation. This author recommends that clinical, interventional research efforts be devoted to exploring optimal neurorehabilitative and enrichment conditions to stimulate plasticity and enhance functioning to determine the extent to which promising results from preclinical studies of lead-induced brain damage and the mitigation of these effects can be successfully translated to humans. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12371},

	abstract = {When applied to structured data, conventional random cross-validation techniques can lead to underestimation of prediction error, and may result in inappropriate model selection. We present the r package blockCV, a new toolbox for cross-validation of species distribution modelling. Although it has been developed with species distribution modelling in mind, it can be used for any spatial modelling. The package can generate spatially or environmentally separated folds. It includes tools to measure spatial autocorrelation ranges in candidate covariates, providing the user with insights into the spatial structure in these data. It also offers interactive graphical capabilities for creating spatial blocks and exploring data folds. Package blockCV enables modellers to more easily implement a range of evaluation approaches. It will help the modelling community learn more about the impacts of evaluation approaches on our understanding of predictive performance of species distribution models.},

	abstract = {One of the most consistent findings in developmental criminology is the "age-crime curve"-the observation that criminal behavior increases in adolescence and decreases in adulthood. Recently, Brown and Males (Justice policy J 8:1-30, 2011) conducted an analysis of aggregate arrest, poverty, and population data from California and concluded that the widely-observed adolescent peak in rates of offending is not a consequence of developmental factors, but rather an artifact of age differences in economic status. Youngsters, they argue, offend more than adults because they are poorer than adults. The present study challenges Brown and Males' proposition by analyzing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY97; N = 8,984; 51\% female; 26\% Black, 21\% Hispanic, 52\% non-Black, non-Hispanic; ages 12-18 at Wave 1), which collected measures of criminal behavior and economic status at multiple time points. Consistent with scores of other studies, we find that criminal offending peaks in adolescence, even after controlling for variation in economic status. Our findings both counter Brown and Males' claim that the age-crime curve is illusory and underscore the danger of drawing inferences about individual behavior from analysis of aggregated data.},
