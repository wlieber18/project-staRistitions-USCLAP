## **Introduction**

Could exposure to lead increase one's likelihood of going to prison? After our team's systematic review of studies, we have explored the potential effects of lead exposure on brain development in children and adults. Various existing studies highlight the detrimental effects of lead on different brain regions, noticeable in a decrease in executive control and cognitive control, thereby affecting memory, mood, behavior and comprehension skills. Such exposure to lead during the developmental years of children causes irreversible damage, the effects of which can be seen later on in life. 

Studies in the past, such as one conducted by Talayero et al. (2023)^1^, have highlighted a strong association between lead exposure during childhood and criminal tendencies during adulthood. One can be exposed to lead through different means, including water, which is the medium which we’ve chosen to investigate. Our research topic inquires about whether a relationship exists between a specified area's water lead levels and its incarceration rates, while also considering potential confounding effects of other demographic factors.

This research topic has important societal implications, namely the complicated intersection of crime, environmental racism, and more. It’s an ever relevant question today and we hope to come to meaningful conclusions by the end of our analysis. Our initial hypothesis is that there is a positive relationship between water lead levels and the rate of incarceration with the existence of other interaction effects from things such as race and income. However, we acknowledge the intricate combination of social and institutional factors that increases one's likelihood of incarceration and are understand the possibility for inconclusive findings with the focus on lead exposure.

## Our Data

We've chosen to create our dataframe from a variety of census data relating to California in 2020. Our data looks at different California census tracts and their respective statistics relating to blood lead levels, income, incarceration rates, and racial demographics. For our analysis, we are particularly focused on `perc_bll_indicator`, `med_income`, our age and race variables and how well they can predict `imprisonment_rt`. The demographic data was collected through the Census data collection process which involves online surveys, in-person questionnaires, and is self-reported. The blood lead level data was compiled using the mandatory reported data entered by laboratories and healthcare workers. The data was sorted into census tracts based on reported street address and observations deemed false positive or false negative by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) have been omitted. To clean the data, we joined each dataset to each other based on census tract and renamed columns for clarity. In addition, we calculated new columns to simplify categories (i.e. age ranges, ethnicity) and omitted fields which would not be relevant for this investigation.

**Note:** Figures referenced throughout the report can be found in the Appendix section.

```

**Blood Lead Levels (Figure 1):** There are 94 census tracts that didn't test blood lead levels in this data. These will likely need to be removed because these observations are not useful in the analysis. Additionally, there is a large concentration of census tracts that have a percent blood level indicator (bll) of 0 (1899 observations). While these should probably be included in the final analysis, removing these for data visualization produces a unimodal distributon that is heavily right skewed. Overall, the median blood level is `r bll_med` and the IQR is `r bll_iqr`.

![Figure 4: Spatial Distribution of BLL in California](data/Layout.png){width="200"}

**Spatial Distribution (Figure 2):** Given the spatial nature of this investigation, it is important to understand how the reported lead levels vary across the state. This map shows that there are contiguous series of tracts, especially in the Los Angeles region, where there may be spatial correlation. This is not surprising, as we expect water conditions across tracts to be similar.

inc_med <- median(bll_data$med_income, na.rm = TRUE)
inc_iqr <- IQR(bll_data$med_income, na.rm = TRUE)
```

**Incarceration Rate (Figure 3):** After removing extreme outliers (the top 1% incarceration rates - some may ultimately be removed because the census tract has an extremely low population ex. \~3 people), the shape of the distribution is unimodal and right skewed. The median incarceration rate is `r carc_med` out of 100,000 with an IQR of `r carc_iqr`. This doesn't appear surprising - there are fewer census tracts with particularly high imprisonment rates.

**Income (Figure 6):** The shape of the income distribution is also unimodal with a less extreme right skew and a median value of `r inc_med` and iqr of `r inc_iqr`. This doesn't appear surprising - we'd expect median incomes of tracts to be concentrated towards the left.

  theme_classic()  

```

**Imprisonment vs BLL Indicator (Figure 4):** Imprisonment rate and the percentage of a census tract with a high bll has a weak positive correlation - at first glance, the bll indicator doesn't seem to have significant explanatory power for the variability in a census tract's imprisonment rate.

**Imprisonment vs Median Income (Figure 7):** Imprisonment rate and median income has a generally negative correlation. This isn't surprising as it is generally understood that a lack of resources, including financial, can be a driving force towards engaging in illegal activities.

**Imprisonment vs Population Aged 15-29 (Figure 8):** Imprisonment rate and percentage of population aged 15-29 in the census tract has a generally positive correlation. This isn't surprising as it's generally understood that one's likekihood to engage in illegal activieis is higher as an adolescent.

**Potential Interactions (Figure 9):**

```{r}
#| label: interaction-effects-code
#| fig-show: hide

bll_data <- bll_data %>%
  mutate(POC_other = black + native_am + other_race, 
         race_categorical = ifelse(POC_other > median(POC_other, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                   "above_median_poc_other", 
                                   "below_median_poc_other"))

bll_data %>% 
filter(perc_bll_indicator <= quantile(perc_bll_indicator, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(imprisonment_rt <= quantile(imprisonment_rt, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(num_bll != 0) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = med_income, y = imprisonment_rt, color = race_categorical)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between income and imprisonment",
    subtitle = "By median percentages of Black, Native American, and other races",
    x = "Median Income",
    y = "Imprisonment Rate",
    color = "Above or below median"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

There appears to be an interaction effect between race and income, as the relationship between median income and imprisonment rate differs by race. We created a variable, POC_other, indicating the percentage of a census tract population that is non-White. In this figure we categorized tracts with POC_other values that were above and below the median in the data of this variable to create a categorical split. The relationship between imprisonment rate and income appears more negatively correlated when the percentatge of non-white people in the census tract is above the median.

## Methodology and Results

For our analysis process, we iterated through different models until we were satisfied with its conditions and performance. As an initial model, we did simple linear regression to predict a census tract’s imprisonment rate using bll indicator variable, racial makeup, median income, median age, the percentage of males, and the interaction between income and race. The model output and conditions are below:

### **Checking Initial Modelling Conditions**

```{r}
#| label: intial-conditions
#| fig.cap: Initial model output

#filtering data points where num_bll = 0
bll_data_checking <- bll_data %>% 
  filter(num_bll != 0)

bll_full_model <- lm(imprisonment_rt ~ perc_bll_indicator + POC_other + med_income + median_age + perc_male + med_income * POC_other, data = bll_data) 

tidy(bll_full_model) %>% 
kable(digits = 3)

set.seed(210)

full_model_aug <- augment(bll_full_model)

```

```{r}
#| label: residual-plot-code-1
#| fig-show: hide

#there is one point with a residual so large the graph is not readable if we keep it. Filtering it out.
full_model_aug |>
  filter(.rownames != 2421) %>% 
  filter(.std.resid < 80) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .std.resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs Fitted Values",
    x = "Fitted",
    y = "Standardized Residuals"
  )

#vif_fm <- vif(bll_full_model)
#vif_fm

#There does not appear to be too much multicollinearity.
```

Using the residual vs fitted plot **(Figure 10),** we can assess the model conditions. From this graph, we find

1.  Normality condition can be relaxed.
2.  Linearity condition not satisfied. Points not randomly scattered around the x = 0 line.
3.  Constant variance condition not satisfied. Points fan out across the x = 0 line.
4.  Independence condition also may not be satisfied. Census tracts next to each other could be more likely to have similar incarceration rates or blood lead levels.

Based on these initial conditions, we decided it would make sense to log transform some of our variables, specifically our median income and imprisonment rate variables.

```{r}
#| label: condition-checking
#| fig-show: hide
#Now going to check for the need to transform any variables

```

    log_imprisonment_rt = log(imprisonment_rt + 1) 
  ) %>% 
  filter(imprisonment_rt != 0)

log_model_checking <- lm(log_imprisonment_rt ~ log_med_income + perc_bll_indicator + 
                POC_other + median_age + perc_male, data = bll_data_transformed)

  )


#vif_fm_log <- vif(log_model_checking)
#vif_fm_log

#Stripe is gone- happened after removing census tracts where imprisonment rate is equal to zero. We can leave the stripe in for this analysis and attribute it to these tracts.

```

**Splitting the Data**

We were also concerned about spatial correlation amongst census tracts especially since there can be multiple within a single county meaning they would share a lot of features. So we originally split the data with 20% in training and 80% testing to minimize this effect. We received abysmal R squared values when doing this. Using ChatGPT for suggestions, it recommended spatial cross validation, which we researched further to ensure it made sense for our analysis^2^. It appeared to be a feasible method to address model overfitting and independence issues within our data. Because of that, we were then able to do a 80% training, 20% testing split.

### Final Model Selection

With our transformed variables, we got a better residuals plot **(Figure 11)** with only a single outlier. From there, we arrived at our final model using stepwise selection on our 80/20 split data to determine what predictor variables were most significant. Through this method, we found that indicators of bll in a census tract isn't statistically significant in predicting their imprisonment rate. However, median income, age, an the interaction between income and the racial makeup of a census tract were the most statiscitaly significant in this model.

## Discussion

Our ultimate research goal was to determine how well blood lead levels can explain rates of imprisonment, with a focus on California census tracts. We hypothesized that there would be a significant relationship based on existing research linking lead exposure to increased criminial tendencies. We also wanted to factor in other various social factors that are well understood to have effects on one's likelihood to be imprisoned, such as racial and financial demographic data. Based on our final chosen model, it appears that the blood lead levels of a census tract aren't statistically significant in predicting imprisonment rate while, income, age, and the interaction between income and race came out as our most significant predictors. We understand that the circumstances surrounding once likelihood of being imprisoned are complex and based on our analysis it appears that lead exposure isn't a particularly useful metric. General discourse on this topic seems to reveal that differing results in studies may be due to the overstated effect of lead exposure on incarceration rate or at the very least, it's not a useful metric on its own.

In terms of potential limitations or future changes of our analysis methods, it would be interesting to incorporate even more geographical regions as there are many states that currently have significant levels of lead exposure.
