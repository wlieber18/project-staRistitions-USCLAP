**Abstract**

Exposure to lead can have a wide variety of negative effects on a
child's brain development and behavior, which may permanently affect
learning and achievement outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated a
relationship between lead exposure and damaging long-term behavior that
leads to negative outcomes. Using data from 9,114 California census
tract, this study examines the relationship between lead exposure and
incarceration rates utilizing the blood lead levels (BLL) of children
reported through state Medicaid enrollment. Using 2020 data from the
Census Bureau, the Prison Policy Initiative, and the California
Department of Public Health, we employed spatial cross-validation and
multiple linear regression models to predict incarceration rates by
census tract, considering demographic factors like income, race, and
age. The analysis found weak correlations between BLL and incarceration
rate, with median income, median age, and racial composition of the
census tract emerging as more significant predictors. The final model
demonstrated moderate explanatory power (R-squared = 0.497). Our
findings suggest that BLL is not a significant predictor of
incarceration rates, emphasizing the stronger influence of socioeconomic
and racial factors.

## **1 Introduction**

In the mid-1990s, the US experienced a sharp downward trend in crime.
Although determinants of crime are intertwined with many complex social
and environmental factors, some researchers cite decreasing childhood
lead exposure, accomplished through policies banning lead in paint and
gasoline, as a plausible explanation (Wallace, 2017). A substantial body
of research documents the adverse effects of lead exposure on brain
development--children exposed to lead experience speech delays, learning
disabilities, struggle with reading comprehension and math, and may
experience behavioral changes (Schneider, 2023). Further, research by
Talayero et al. (2023) has highlighted a strong association between lead
exposure during childhood and criminal tendencies during adulthood.
Understanding and documenting evidence for adverse outcomes is
particularly important given children from low-income households are
more likely to be at risk for lead exposure (CDC, 2024). This research
stands to contribute to important discussions at the intersection of
crime, environmental racism, and social determinants of health.

Within this context, the authors constructed a study to determine
whether the percentage of children with BLLs above 3.5 "µg" in a given
census tract was a significant predictor of incarceration rate in that
census tract. Using other demographic variables, like median age, median
income, racial composition, and gender composition, our analysis sought
to determine: **(1) Is there an association between percentage of
children with a high BLL and incarceration rate** and **(2) If there is
an association, is it significant compared to well-established
predictors of likelihood to be incarcerated, like SES, race, gender, and
age?** Using multiple linear regression models and spatial cross
validation, we found that though a higher BLL was correlated with a
higher incarceration rate in a given census tract, it was not a
significant predictor of incarceration rate. Income in particular was a
far stronger predictor of incarceration rate and was associated with the
biggest decrease in predicted incarceration rate. These results
highlight known disparities in the criminal justice system, but are
limited by the intricate combination of social and institutional factors
that increases one's likelihood of incarceration and the inability of
this study to establish causal relationships between lead exposure and
incarceration rate. The authors also note that blood lead levels as
measured in children likely underestimates true lead exposure in a given
census tract.

## **2 Materials & Methods**

### **2.1 Data sets**

Data for this study were obtained from three sources. California
incarceration rates comes from a collaborative project by the Essie
Justice Group and the Prison Policy Initiative
(https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ca/2020/tract.html). PPI reports
incarceration rate by census tract via data collected by the US Census
Bureau in 2020. This data is publicly available because of a 2020 law in
California reforming prison gerrymandering. Each census tract in the
incarceration rate data was matched with median age, percent male,
median income, and racial composition data from the 2020 US Census.
Finally, BLL data was obtained from the California Department of Public
Health (CDPH). Notably, this data was aggregated from 2018-2022 to
protect individual privacy. The final merged data set contained 9,114
California census tracts and their respective statistics relating to
blood lead levels, income, incarceration rates, and racial demographics.
The 94 census tracts that screened zero children for blood lead level
were excluded from this analysis. Observations deemed false positives or
false negatives by the CDPH were preemptively omitted by CDPH reporting
procedures.

**Note:** Figures referenced throughout the report can be found in the
Appendix section.

### **2.2 Data processing and analysis**

This study investigated the relationship between incarceration rate and
blood lead level while controlling for additional variables, including
age, gender, race, and income. All variables were continuous. A new
variable, *POC_other*, was created to account for the racial composition
of the census tract by the percentage of the population that is Black,
Native, or Hispanic non-white (Table A1).

Spatial correlation among nearby census tracts was likely. Tracts next
to each other may share similar characteristics such as policing
practices, built environments, and school systems that could potentially
impact rates of incarceration, particularly near Los Angeles county
(Figure B4). To address this independence problem, the authors employed
spatial cross validation to attempt to mitigate the effects of spacial
correlation. Figure C1 illustrate the division of census tracts into
five spatial blocks, each representing a fold used in spatial
cross-validation. These blocks were generated with a block range of 100
km, ensuring that observations within each fold are spatially clustered
and that training and testing sets are geographically separated.
Geographical distance is the only factor involved in generating the
folds–other variables and their coefficients are not involved (Valavi et
al., 2018).

## **3 Results**

### **3.1 Descriptive Analysis and Initial Modelling**

Descriptive analysis indicated that incarceration rates and income
distributions within California census tracts were right skewed (Figures
B1 & B2). The authors elected to log transform these variables, which
produced a residual plot that appeared to satisfy conditions of constant
variance and linearity. Normality was also satisfied (n \> 30). No data
points displayed a cook's distance greater than 0.5, and as a result, no
points were deemed influential.

The highly correlated nature of race and income lead the authors to
examine a potential interaction effect. In Figure B3, a categorical
variable flagged *POC_other* values that were above and below the median
*POC_other* value to create a categorical split. The relationship
between imprisonment rate and income appeared more negatively correlated
when the percentage of *POC_other* in the census tract was above the
median, leading to the inclusion of an interaction term between race and
income in the initial model.

### **3.3 Multiple Linear Regression Models**

The multiple linear regression models revealed the significance of BLL
in predicting incarceration rate, the effects of other examined
variables, and the significance of the interaction term between
*median_income* and *POC_other* (Table C2). The model was trained on
bins 1-4 of the spatially cross validated data, which represented
approximately 80% of the census tracts. *log_imprisonment_rt,*
*log_med_income, perc_bll_indicator, POC_other, median_age, perc_male*,
and the interaction between *POC_other* and *log_med_income* were
included in the full model. Stepwise selection using AIC resulted in the
exclusion of *perc_bll_indicator, or BLL level*, which the authors
forced back into the model because it was the variable of interest.
*log_median_income* (centered) demonstrated the strongest negative
relationship with predicted incarceration rate ($\beta = 0.515$,
$p \approx 0$). Increasing *POC_other* also increased the predicted rate
of incarceration ($\beta = 1.016$, $p \approx 0$). The interaction term
between income and race was significant ($\beta = 1.004$,
$p \approx 0$). More men in a census tract, *perc_mal*e, increased the
predicted rate of incarceration ($\beta = 1.008$, $p \approx 0$). Blood
lead level was not a significant predictor ($p > 0.005$). Finally, an
increasing median age was associated with an increase in the predicted
incarceration rate ($\beta = 1.005$, $p \approx 0$).

Testing the model on the 5th bin of the spatially cross validated data,
which represented approximately 20% of the census tracts, yielded an R
squared value of 0.497 and an RMSE of 190.679 (Table C4). VIF values for
all variables were below 3 when interaction terms were removed.

## **4 Discussion**

This analysis aligns with prior research on social determinants of
crime, as race, income, and gender are well-established factors
influencing likelihood of incarceration (Ghandnoosh, 2023). One uprising
exception was age. Likelihood of committing a crime peaks just after
adolescence and rapidly diminishes thereafter (Shulman, Steinberg, and
Piquero, 2013). This analysis found that predicted incarceration rate
*increases* with an increasing *median_age*. This is likely a limitation
of using *median_age,* as the age–related relationship with
incarceration is specific to the percentage of the population that is
around 18-25 years old.

Notably, BLL is not statistically significant in predicting
incarceration rate. The outstanding significance of other established
factors, such as income, reveals that differing results may be due to
the misunderstood or overstated effect of lead exposure on incarceration
rate. At the very least, this analysis indicates that BLL is not a
useful metric on its own. However, the R squared value of 0.497
indicates that the model is fairly successful at capturing complex
real-world drivers of incarceration rates.

An important limitation of our current analysis is the method of
measuring BLL in a given census tract. BLL levels in children were used
to approximate to approximate risk of lead exposure for all people in
the census tract, which may not be an accurate representation of the
reality. A better method would be to combine BLL testing in children
with other forms of measuring potential for lead exposure, like water
testing or neighborhood environmental assessments. Future research
should strive to confirm the lack of influence of BLL on incarceration
rates through examining other geographical regions or measurements of
lead exposure.
